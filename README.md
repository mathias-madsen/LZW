# LZW
A [micropsi industries](http://www.micropsi-industries.com) whitepaper interpreting the [Lempel-Ziv-Welch coding scheme](https://www.google.com/patents/US4558302) as an implicitly defined stochastic process, with illustrative code snippets.

Test documents included in this repository:

 * a discussion of the [theory behind the LZW coding scheme](/The_LZW_Coding_Scheme_as_an_Example_of_Sequence_Prediction_by_Data_Compression.pdf)
 * a presentation of [some results about ergodic processes](/Random Processes and Ergodicity.pdf)
 * a bullet-pointed [cheat sheet about ergodicity](/Ergodicity - Definitions and Examples.pdf)

The two latter documents were written previously for [a course on information theory I taught in 2015](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~schaffne/courses/inftheory/2015/).
